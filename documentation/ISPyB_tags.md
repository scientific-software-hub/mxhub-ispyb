# How to create tags for ISPyB

## example: 5.14.2.1

- 5: First version number of ISPyB and EXI major framework changes

- 14: Second version number changes of data base and/or web services - breaking compatibility with EXI or another web client calling the webservices.

- 2: Third version number of ISPyB corresponds to changes not breaking compatibility, for example : changes in the ISPyB GUI, changes in ispyb-ejb or ispyb-ws not impacting webservices API like refactoring, changes in webpages, changes in packaging.

- 1: Fourth version number corresponds to really minor changes


## example: compatibity with EXI 5.14.3.12

- 5.14: The first and second number must correspond between ISPyB and EXI

- 3: Third version number in EXI corresponds to changes in EXI excluding web service changes

- 12: Fourth version number corresponds to really minor changes
